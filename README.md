# Who, When, and Why (ONY)
This is a quip Live App that helps document authors to add basic information to the top of their documents in order to reduce document rot. In technology our documents tend to get out of date quickly as we are always innovating. Adding the author(s), the month and year when the doc was created, and why the doc was created help readers quickly understand the value of the document.

## Usage
In a Quip document simply type @ONY and use the Live App!
